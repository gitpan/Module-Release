You can install this using in the usual Perl fashion

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
	
The documentation is in the module file.  Once you install
the file, you can read it with perldoc.

	perldoc Module::Release

Look at the example script in script/release.
	
This module is also in CVS on SourceForge

	http://sourceforge.net/projects/brian-d-foy/
