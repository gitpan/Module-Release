=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Module::Release> automates your software release process. It started as
a script that automated my release process, so it has bits to
talk to PAUSE (CPAN) and SourceForge, and to use C<Makefile.PL> and
C<CVS>. Other people have extended this in other modules under the same
namespace so you can use C<Module::Build>, C<svn>, and many other things.

The methods represent a step in the release process. Some of them check a
condition (e.g. all tests pass) and die if that doesn't work.
C<Module::Release> doesn't let you continue if something is wrong. Once
you have checked everything, use the upload features to send your files
to the right places.

The included C<release> script is a good starting place. Don't be afraid to
edit it for your own purposes.

=head2 Configuration

C<Module::Release> looks at several sources for configuration information.

=head3 Perl setup

C<Module::Release> looks at C<Config> to get the values it needs for
certain operations.

=over 4

=item make

The name of the program to run for the C<make> steps

=back

=head3 Environment variables

=over 4

=item PERL

Use this value as the perl interpreter, otherwise use the value in C<$^X>

=item RELEASE_DEBUG

Do you want debugging output? Set this to a true value

=item SF_PASS

Your SourceForge password. If you don't set this and you want to
upload to SourceForge, you should be prompted for it. Failing that,
the module tries to upload anonymously but cannot claim the file for
you.

=item CPAN_PASS

Your CPAN password. If you don't set this and you want to upload to
PAUSE, you should be prompted for it. Failing that, the module tries
to upload anonymously but cannot claim the file for you.

=back

=head3 C<.releaserc>

C<Module::Release> looks for either C<.releaserc> or C<releaserc> in
the current working directory. It reads that with
C<ConfigReader::Simple> to get these values:

=over 4

=item release_subclass

The subclass of C<Module::Release> that you want to use. This allows
you to specify the subclass via a F<.releaserc> file; otherwise you
wouldn't be able to use the C<release> script because the
C<Module::Release> class name is hard-coded there.

=item makefile_PL

The name of the file to run as F<Makefile.PL>.  The default is
C<"Makefile.PL">, but you can set it to C<"Build.PL"> to use a
C<Module::Build>-based system.

=item makefile

The name of the file created by C<makefile_PL> above.  The default is
C<"Makefile">, but you can set it to C<"Build"> for
C<Module::Build>-based systems.

=item cpan_user

Your PAUSE user id.

=item sf_user

Your SourceForge account (i.e. login) name.

=item passive_ftp

Set this to a true value to enable passive FTP.

=item sf_group_id

The Group ID of your SourceForge project. This is a numeric ID given to
the project usually, and you can see it in the URLs when you browse
the SourceForge files area.

=item sf_package_id

The Package ID of your SourceForge package. This is a numeric ID given to
a particular file release, and you can see it in the URLs when you browse
the SourceForge files area.

=item sf_release_match

This is a regular expression. Given the file release name that
C<Module::Release> picks (e.g. "Foo-Bar-1.15.tgz"), you can run a
substitution on it. The replacement string is in C<sf_release_replace>.

=item sf_release_replace

This is a regular expression. Given the file release name that
C<Module::Release> picks (e.g. "Foo-Bar-1.15.tgz"), you can run a
substitution on it. The regex portion is in C<sf_release_match>.

=item sf_type_id 5002

The distribution type (e.g. "gzipped source") of the package, by numeric
ID that you have to look up on your own from the SourceForge form. The
default is 5002 (".gz source").

=item sf_processor_id

The processor type (e.g. Intel Pentium) of the package, by numeric
ID that you have to look up on your own from the SourceForge form.
The default is 8000 ("Any").

=back

=head2 Methods

If you don't like what any of these methods do, override them in a subclass.

=over 4

=item new()

Create a Module::Release object.  Any arguments passed are assumed to
be key-value pairs that override the default values.

object;

Return the output filehandle, or the null filehandle if we're running in

It's STDOUT or nothing

=item check_manifest

Run `make manifest` and report anything it finds. If it gives output,
die. You should check C<MANIFEST> to ensure it has the things it needs.
If files that shouldn't show up do, put them in MANIFEST.SKIP.

Since `make manifest` takes care of things for you, you might just have
to re-run your release script.

Run a command in the shell.

Returns true if the command ran successfully, and false otherwise. Use
this function in any other method that calls run to figure out what to
do when a command doesn't work. You may want to handle that yourself.

=item _print( LIST )

Send the LIST to whatever is in output_fh, or to STDOUT. If you set
output_fh to a null filehandle, output goes nowhere.

	print { $self->output_fh || *STDOUT } @_;

=item _debug( LIST )

Send the LIST to whatever is in debug_fh, or to STDERR. If you are
debugging, debug_fh should return a null filehandle,

=head1 TO DO

* What happened to my Changes munging?

=head1 CREDITS

Ken Williams turned my initial release(1) script into the present
module form.

Andy Lester handled the maintenance while I was on my Big Camping
Trip. He applied patches from many authors.

Andreas Koenig suggested changes to make it work better with PAUSE.

Chris Nandor helped with figuring out the broken SourceForge stuff.

=head1 SOURCE AVAILABILITY

This source is part of a SourceForge project which always has the
latest sources in SVN, as well as all of the previous releases. This
source now lives in the "Module/Release" section of the repository,
and older sources live in the "release" section.

	http://sourceforge.net/projects/brian-d-foy/

If, for some reason, I disappear from the world, one of the other
members of the project can shepherd this module appropriately.
