=head1 NAME

Module::Release::MANIFEST - Check Perl's MANIFEST to ensure you've updated it

=head1 SYNOPSIS

The release script automatically loads this module and checks your
MANIFEST file. It runs C<{make|Build} manifest> and dies if the
output contains any lines that start with C<added> or C<removed>.

If it dies, you have to start the release process again after
verifying F<MANIFEST> (and F<MANIFEST.SKIP>).

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=over 4

=item check_MANIFEST

Runs C<{make|Build} manifest>. If it sees output
starting with C<added> or C<removed>, it dies.

It looks in C<local_name> to get the name of the distribution file.

There's a slight problem with this command. It might re-order the
list of files in F<MANIFEST>. Although this doesn't bother this
command, it might make the file dirty for source control.
